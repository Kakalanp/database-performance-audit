# database-performance-audit

This is a relational database with the data structure for a vet clinic; a complete database with data about:
    animals
    animals' owners
    clinic employees
    visits
Apart from building data structure, the database will create SQL queries to answer specific questions.

A performance audit is also available in the files.

## Getting Started
This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:
- Run PostgreSQL on your machine, and then start psql to start inputting the data on the files.
- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
